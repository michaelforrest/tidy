Ruby just makes you want to do things neatly. Even Flash development.

TidyFlash sets up a project that follows a set of conventions simplifying
	- Typography
	- Animation
	- MVC
	- XML parsing
	- Preloading
	- Layout
	- Low-bandwidth simulation
	- Unit testing
	- AIR development

USAGE:
	tidyflash SomeProject
	cd SomeProject
	rake


INSTALLATION ON MAC:
	gem install tidyflash


INSTALLATION ON UBUNTU:

	sudo apt-get install ruby rake rubygems libopenssl-ruby git-core ubuntu-restricted-extras
	gem install tidyflash

Make sure you have the rubygems bin folders in your path
	echo "PATH=/var/lib/gems/1.8/bin:~/.gem/ruby/1.8/bin:\$PATH" >> ~/.bashrc && . ~/.bashrc

For now, you'll need to hack:

	/var/lib/gems/1.8/gems/sprout-as3-bundle-1.0.36/lib/sprout/fcsh_service.rb 

to reference flex4sdk instead of flex3sdk
