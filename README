Following in the footsteps of Ruby On Rails, Processing, _why's Shoes and Luke Bayes' Sprouts library, here is a Flash framework that funnels the brilliance of all these people into a single set of libraries for developing Flash.

USAGE:

	tidyproject SomeProject
	cd SomeProject
	rake

BEFORE YOU START (on Ubuntu)

	sudo apt-get install ruby rake rubygems libopenssl-ruby git-core ubuntu-restricted-extras
	gem install tidyflash

and make sure you have the rubygems bin folders in your path
	edit ~/.bashrc
add the line:
	export PATH=/var/lib/gems/1.8/bin:~/.gem/ruby/1.8/bin:$PATH


and for now, hack

/var/lib/gems/1.8/gems/sprout-as3-bundle-1.0.36/lib/sprout/fcsh_service.rb 

to reference flex4sdk instead of flex3sdk
